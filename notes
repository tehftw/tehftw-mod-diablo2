TODO:

1. elemental resistance jewelry recipes

2. sockets, sockets, sockets! sockets in boots, gloves, belt!


BAR:

1. only 1 BARbarian warcry-buff effect at the same time

2. revamp "weapon mastery". Maybe separate passives: CriticalStrike , CrushingBlow , OpenWounds , MagicDamage

1. lower numbers are better. only normies like high numbers for the sake of high numbers. keep the numbers low!

2. 1-hit-kill is bad. damage should be balanced in such a way, that a character of correct level with nonperfect blue gear can survive. not "just stand like the main character of bad animango whilst everything hits you", rather "stay on your feet and you won't die"

3. but, if you get surrounded - your problem, and you deserve death. crowd control should be a big part of game

4. important quote I heard: "dont linger" whilst playing Gauntlet

---	items specialization

items should be more specialized. currently, too many item slots have too many
possible properties.

Helm: ArmorClass , Stats , Resistance

Chest: ArmorClass , Resistance , OtherDefensive(Thorns , HitRecovery , etc)

Belt: Stats , GetHitSkill , 

Boots: Stamina , HitRecovery , ArmorClass , RunSpeed

Gloves: OffensiveModifiers(Heal) , OnHitSkill , CastRate , FastBlock

Ring/Amulet: all things arcane: magic resistances , Energy


---	damage type specialization

enlarge differences between damage types:

fire	consistent, medium damage

cold	weak damage , slow

ltng	highly variable , potentially ultra damage

pois	damage over time , high total damage


also, make more stuff with magic damage. both in terms of dealing and defending

---	recipe plans

this is mostly done now, as Crafted items. I leave the names because they look
fun

---	gold sinks

currently, only melee fighters have reliable gold sinks(repairs)

ideas:

# magic casters

1. elixirs : boost energy

2. scrolls and charged items with powerful(some exclusive) buffs

3. special mana potions that cost a lot

# bowazon:

1. high cost of arrows/bolt
